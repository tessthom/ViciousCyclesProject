        <h3>Event Spotlight: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)" target="_blank">Critical Mass</a></h3>
        <p>Join the Vicious Cycles crew for Durham's monthly Critical Mass ride! Every second Saturday, at a different time and location, a whole bunch of local cyclists come together to reclaim the streets and celebrate pedal power. We use this event as an opportunity to communicate the value of biking as transportation to our local representatives, and ask for the common sense changes that will make Durham a safe space to ride in.</p>
        <p>Sign up for our newsletter to get the details for this month's Critical Mass and other community events. The more, the merrier and the greater chance we have of making positive change. Critical Mass has a productive relationship with local officials and most months we're even joined by a few!</p>
        <p>Nervous to participate in direct action, but want to support the cause? No worries! Vicous Cycles wants every rider to feel comfortable and will keep you in the loop on a variety of opportunities to engage with the Triangle area cycling community. Whether you're on training wheels or dialing in your sprint diagnostics, Vicious Cycles has got a group for you.</p>
